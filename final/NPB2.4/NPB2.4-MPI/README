CAUTION *********************************
When running the I/O benchmark, one or more data files will be written
in the directory from which the executable is invoked. They are not
deleted at the end of the program. A new run will overwrite the old
file(s). If not enough space is available in the user partition, the
program will fail. For classes C and D the disk space required is
3 GB and 135 GB, respectively.

Changes in 2.4

- Added I/O benchmark (subtype of BT).
- Added Class D for all benchmarks except IS.
- Reduced size of tabulated exponentials in FT.
- Made minor changes to FT to prevent integer overflow for class D on 
  systems with 32-bit integers. FT class D will not run on small 
  numbers of processors anymore.
